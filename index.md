# Our Goal

Our organization's goal is to first convert unsecured intellectual property (IP) in the form of "inventions" into secured intellectual property in the form of US utility patents. Next we then leverage our portfolio by licensing or directly selling patents to our clients. 

# About Us

Our founder is Ryan Milkovits, a UCSD graduate and entrepeneur with past startup and patent experience involving drones and biotech. Currently we are seeking to grow our company with new employees that will be compensated with company stock.

# Contact Us

Contact us at (619) 707-7362 or rmilkovits@gmail.com if you would like to work with us. We can generate inventions in your desired area if you reach out to us with a requested type of invention and then acquire the patent for you to buy or license.
