# Our Goal

Our goal is to advance the technological state-of-the-art in different categories by creating new "inventions" in various fields of business and technology. All of our inventions are protected under copyright protection and we patent our best ideas, based upon priority and value, to further protect our inventions under the US patent system.

# Our Process

Our organization develops technology by creating new technological ideas, or "inventions". We then convert the unsecured intellectual property (IP) of our "inventions" into secured intellectual property in the form of US utility patents. Finally, we leverage our portfolio by licensing or directly selling patents to our clients. 

# About Us

Our founder and CEO is Ryan Milkovits, a UCSD graduate and entrepeneur with past startup and patent experience involving drones and biotech. Currently we are seeking to grow our company with new employees that may be wholly or partially compensated with company stock.

# Contact Us

Contact us at (442) 217-1889 or rmilkovits@gmail.com if you would like to work with us. We have multiple IP Portfolios that you can view if you agree to the associated NDA (and Non-Use/Non-Patent) Agreement. We can generate inventions for any desired domain or commercial sector if you reach out to us with a requested type of invention for us to generate in less than a week so that you can purchase the invention or patent (which we can do for you if you provide our company money to assist with that task).
