# Our Goal

Our goal is to advance the technological state-of-the-art in different categories by creating new "inventions" in various fields of business and technology. We then also work with experts in the domains of intellectual property law to protect our inventions under the US patent system.

# Our Process

Our organization's develops technology by creating new technological ideas, or "inventions". We then convert the unsecured intellectual property (IP) of our "inventions" into secured intellectual property in the form of US utility patents. Finally, we leverage our portfolio by licensing or directly selling patents to our clients. 

# About Us

Our founder is Ryan Milkovits, a UCSD graduate and entrepeneur with past startup and patent experience involving drones and biotech. Currently we are seeking to grow our company with new employees that will be compensated with company stock.
